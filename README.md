# THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED

**Update (March 2, 2022)**: As a group of developers who met through the Opera Browser community, we originally started this project with plans to patch malformed web pages that were improperly rendered when using Opera Presto. Before this project was completed, Opera migrated its rendering engine to Chromium, eliminating most of these rendering issues.

# What is Fix the Web?
*Fix the Web* is an extension-in-progress for [Opera Web Browser](http://www.opera.com/browser). Many web pages use malformed HTML, poorly-written Javascript, or bad web development practices such as browser-sniffing. Consequently, these pages could produce visual flaws, functional glitches, or even worse, be completely nonfunctional in Opera, a standards-conforming web browser. 

## What is purpose of this extension?
The goal of *Fix the Web* is to provide a solution to these problems by allowing users to report site problems they encounter, reply to others' bug reports, and, most importantly, apply patches to broken web pages.

## Applying patches and road-map
Before you apply a patch to a web page, determine how it needs to be fixed. If it only needs a CSS patch, then add the patch to the [CSS patches Wedata database](http://wedata.net/databases/Fix-the-Web/). However, if the web needs a Javascript patch, then add the patch in the **patches.js** file in the *includes/* folder in this repository. Read more about site patching [here](http://my.opera.com/fix-the-web/blog/2012/03/01/how-to-patch-a-web-page).
